steps:
1. first get button working
2. figure out how to style the button

a lot of trouble figuring out how to get the button functionality working properly - so that clikcing it
wouldn't also create a new ball

the problem ended up being where I was defining the variable - in setup instead of before setup

problems are often due to more technical errors than the exact line of code you're writing
