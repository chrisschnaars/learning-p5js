steps:
1. create a triangle class
2. figure out the shooting behavior - not just add one per click
3. how to make triangles move?
3. how to make them stay away from the mouse and the screen edges


creating the triangle wasn't so hard.
had to think about the math of it to orient the triangle around the cursor

getting the shooting to work wasn't too hard once I realized the mouseIsPressed boolean

got the fading out behavior to work after seeing an example on the p5js website that used a variable called
lifespan to control the opacity, and reduce that variable in the move function
