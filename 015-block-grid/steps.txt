steps:
1. create a block class
2. figure out how to extend this across the screen
3. figure out the on/off behavior
4. figure out the hover behavior
5. figure out how to toggle through different colors

1. this was hard. learning about for loops within for loops
2. gettting the logic for the number of squares to be right was difficult. started by dividing the width of the display area by the width of the blocks.
3. added a hover functionality but it seemed to make things slower and make the computer work very hard. not sure what was happening.
4. would love to add some more shapes.
