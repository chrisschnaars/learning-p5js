steps:
1. first out how to get the slider working
	- tried an early example using it to modify the background color
2. figure out how to add a variable in the object


this was relatively hassle free
once i figured out declare the alpha value variable in the display() function, that set me on the path
figuring that out made it easy to figure out how to control the number of balls being intialized
